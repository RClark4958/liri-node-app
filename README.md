# liri-node-app

LIRI is a command-line personal assistant who takes specific commands and retrieves info for the user.

Specifically, LIRI can provide information on upcoming concerts, movie information, song info/previews from Spotify, and he can read .txt files.

LIRI can instruct the user if they mistype a command, and he can handle situations where results are not found or an error has ocurred. 

This project relies heavily on javascript and node technologies. Specific modules need to be installed in order for LIRI to happily operate. 

This repository contains everything a user needs to operate LIRI save for personal API keys. The user will need to supply their own .env file with respective API IDs and secrets.
